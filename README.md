# Challenges during the course of the project
- Some of the challenges that I faced during the project were:
    1. Difficulty in identifying the web elements. Some of them would stop working after a while and then you would have to access them with a different locator.
    2. The speed of the webdriver was also an issue because as it was too fast and its speed couldn't be manipulated as the setspeed functions were not application anymore.
